HAvnm long regarded Halm’s commentarios on Cicero
as admirably fitted to spread a sound knowledge of
those writings, which are the test* of proficiency in
Latin, Ι did not hesitate to recommend his edition to
the class, with which I read the Second Philippic in
the last October term. As however the book was not
accessible to all my hearers, Ι determined to put the
introduction and notes into an English dress.

I have endeavoured to translate the introduction
tolerably closely ς with the notes I have taken greater
liber-ties, abridging, enlarging‚ or omitting at discre-
tion ς where Halm gives a reference to a classic, Ι have
generally printed the passage at length 5 where the
reference is to his own notes on other speeches, or to
modern books, Ι have worked in the additional mat-
ter; Ι have also rendered into English the numerous
Greek quotations.

My own additions·†, which have grown to a far
greater bulk than I had intended, have been drawn,
i. from the ancient authorities for the history of the
period, which I have carefully read over again for the
purpose 3 ii. from my own marginal references, and
grammatical‚ historical, and antiquarian collectione 3
iii. from the notes of previous commentatorsss, among

⁸ Quintilian.

fions. The same mark in the text of the speech denotes an

Ι :t Quintilian's observatione I have quoted at length. I have
also gone through the prolix variorum notes (500 pag-es, double
columns, in Wernsdorf's edition); the eommentary of Manutius ;
the notes of Orelli's smaller edition (cic. Oratt. sel. xv. Turici,
1836) 3 the prefaces of Madvig (Cio. Oratt. sel. m. I have used
the second, third, and fourth editions, Hauniae, 1841, 1848, 1858,
and the profane of the first ed., ibid. 1830, printed in his opuscula
