unauthorised either by the senate or the people, he
deserted his province, in order to reinstate king
Ptolemy Auletes on the throne of Egypt¹⁸. As
commander of cavalry Antonius had opportunity for
the first time of making himself known to fame; he
displayed great wariness and decision in action, and
by his humanity and courtesy left behind him an
honoured name¹⁹ in Alexandrea.

When in the year 54 Gabinius returned to Italy,
Antonius offered his services to O. Iulius Oaesar,
who was then in northern Gaul ⁹⁰. Caesar’s eagle eye
discovered in the bold and ambitione young man the
fitting instrument for the furtherance of his own
designs. In order however to support Caesar's cause
with the necessary external authority, it was indis-
pensable that Antonius should obtain admission to
the senate by filling public offices. Accordingly he
returned (13.c. 53) to Rome, furnished by Oaesar with
recommendatione, to Oicero⁹¹ among others, and pro-
bably also with supplies of money, to vsue for the
quaestorship. Cicero, flattered by Oaesar's application,
lent his countenance to Antonius the more readily,
because the latter, while still a candidate for the
quaestorship, on an occasion of which the particulars ’
are unknown, stoutly assaulted the constant disturber
of the public peace, P. Clodius”. Immediately on
