With respect to the intercession the assembly was
specially asked, whether it should be acknowledged as
valid⁸⁶5 the answer returned was in the negative,
yet it does not appear that on this and the following
days-any formal conclusion was adopted. Not until§ 11
the decisivo session of 6 J an. were the two tribunes,

who stiffiy adhered to their protest, ejected from the
curia by the consul Lentulus, and warned to provide '
for their own' safety³⁶. Antonius rose from his seat
swelling with rage, and hurried from the curia, after
invoking the gods as witnesses of the desecration of
the hallowed office. In the following night he with
Cassius and Curio left the city in a hired carriage and
made the best of his way to Oaesar³⁷. After the
departure of the two tribunes the senate decreed:
darent operam consules, praetores, tribwml pl. quique
pro consulibus essent ad urbem, ne quid re8 publica
