struggle in Africa was not the last which he had to
maintain for the supremaey, which was to be of such
short duration3 the most stubborn of all awaited
him in Spain against the sons of Cn. Pompeius. It
is well known that in the battle of Munda (17 March,
45) a single day had well nigh destroyed the fruits of
years of toils and victories. Oaesar’s dearly-bought
success gave the last blow to the freedom of Rome.

N either in Africam nor in Spain did Antonius §19
fight at Coesar’s side, A coolness had sprung up
between them⁶⁸‚ because Oaesar demanded the pay-
ment of the sum, which Antonius had bid for the
estate of Pompeiusffl’. Antonius was nettled by this
demand, thinking that he had desei-ved so well of

Gaesar, that he might securely reckon on a greater
recompense ⁷⁰. But the dictator insisted, and even
threatened to put in a military execution⁷¹‚ which
determined Antonius to have an auction of goods.
But here too he was foiled 3 for when the heirs of the
knight L. Rubrius, whose inheritance Antonius had
embezzled, put in a claim as owners of the goods

fl §71. Plut. Ant. 10: ‘When the house of Pompeius was
put up for sale, Antonius became the purchaser ; but took in
great dudgeon the demand of payment. He himself declares
that his reason for bearing no part in Caesar's African campaign
was, that his former successes had been unrequited.’ ⁶⁸) As
Plut. (ibid.) hints, Antonius’ dissolute life also had somewhat

him from Oaesar: ‘Oaesar however by shewing him-
self not blind to his failings, seems to have weaned Antonius
in great measure from his folly and profliganyst ⁶⁹) Dio
xm. 50: ‘Oaesar evidently declared his design of appropriating
the property of others to his own use by absolute power3 whereby
he incurred the displeasure even of his own associates ; for after
they had bought up many confiscated, estates, sometimes for
more than the value, in the hope of obtaining them gratis, they
were constrained to make payment in full! Cf. Dio xnn. 49. ἓ 3.
