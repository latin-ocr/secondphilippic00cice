IN TROD U ΟΤΙ ΟΝ. xxxiii

accomplished, Antonius, bclieving himself as Caesar's
friend most exposed to danger, cast away his consular
robe and remained for a time in conceaimenth Ig-
norant alike of the designs of the conspirators and of
the number of their adherents ¹2³, he let slip the oppor-
tunity for a sudden assault upon the Capitol, which
amid the general trepidation could scarcely have failed
of success. In the night Lepidus brought troops into
the city, and made a seint of avenging the dictator’s
murder; but after a conference with Antonius deter-
mined, especially as the disposition of the senate was
not yet declared, to watch the course of events ¹²⁴.

On the following day (March 16) Dolabella ap- ξ 31
peared with the insignia of the consulship. He and
others had in readiness a mercenary throng¹²⁵, under
whose escort Brutus and Cassius ventured to descend
from the Capitol and harangue the assembly. The
result however did not answer to their hopes, so that
they again retreated to their refuge, and found it ex-
pedient to make advances to Antonius, through the
good offices of friendly senators ¹²⁶. Antonius in his
message reminded them of the cath which they had
all sworn to Caesar, that they would defend his life
and avenge every attempt on his person ¹⁶²⁷, but finally

be unauoyed and clear from injustice! [Of. Plut. Brut. 18 and
20]. Appian (Π. 1 14) has a third version: ‘Brutus said, that if
they killed Caesar alone, they would win the reputation of libera-
tors of their country from tyranny, whereas, if they proscribed his
friends also, they would be condemned as mere partisans of
Pompeius, impelleyd by private enm1ty.’1²2) Phil. 11.
