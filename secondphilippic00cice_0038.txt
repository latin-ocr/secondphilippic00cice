were conveyed to the dwelling of Antonius, whether
because Oaesar’s widow Calpurnia thought that they
would there be more secure, or because Antonius had
of his own authority given orders to that effectm.
An edict of Antonius also appeared, summoning the
senate to meet on the next morning-(March 17) in the
temple of Tellus; which was selected for the place of
meeting as adjoining the house of Antonius ¹³⁰. All
approaches to the temple were, as Cicero assures us ¹³¹,

Antonius displayed extraordinary adroitness132, tho
pacific resolution was at last adopted, that no judicial
