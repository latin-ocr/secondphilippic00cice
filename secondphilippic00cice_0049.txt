IN TROD U ΟΤΙ ΟΝ. xlv

Decimus Brutus, Asia to O. Trebonius, to Tillius Cim-
ber Bithynia3 to the praetors M. Brutus and Cassius
Macedonia and Syria were assigned for the year 43,
after the expiration of their year of officem. The first
three had set out for their provinces, either immediately
aster Oaesar’s tumultuous funeral, or in the course of
Apri1¹⁸²³3 which M. Brutus and Cassius as praetors
were unable to do. After the Ides of March they
tarried in Rome for about a month, but since the
decisive day of the burial lived in entire seclusion.
About the middle of April they left Rome, and moved ⁴
to and fro among the municipal towns in the vicinity,
waiting for a possible change of popular feeling, They §4
purposed to shew themselves again in Rome on the
first of June, for on that day Antonius had appointed
a meeting of the senate which was anticipated with
eager excitement; but were daunted by the veterans,
who escorted Antonius on his return from his progress.
One of Antonius' first measures in the month of June
was to secure the permanent removal from Rome of
the two chiefs of the adverse faction. First of all
Brutus was relieved‚ by a lem introduced by Antonius,
from the constitutional restriction which made it ille-
gal for a praetor urbanus ¹⁸⁴ to be absent from the city
more than 10 days; next, also 011 the proposal of
Antonius¹⁸⁵‚ he and Cassius on the 5th of Junc¹⁸⁶
