late praetors should only hold a government for one
year, consulars for not more than two successive years,
and generally, that no imperiwn should be held for a
longer term. Antonius, who hoped one day, like Caesar,
at the head of a formidable force to plunder his Gallia
eisaspinQ instigated tribunes to bring in a bill, where-
by he and Dolabella as consuls of the current year
were guaranteed the exceptione] privilege of a 5-years'
tenure of gov'emment211. When Cicero again entered
Rome, two new bills of Antonius, unmistakably of
democratia tendency, were promulgated, one for the
creation of a third decury of jurors ²¹², the other grant—

for high *reason ²⁷¹³.

praetor L. Aurelius Cotta (Β. 0. 70) created 3 decuries of iudices

peius <B.o. 55) limited the choice to the wealthiest members of
the three orders, and changed the mode of election. Caesar
(B. c. 46) limited the iudicia 1ο senators and kni g.hts Antonius
again created a third decuma, consisting chiefly of centurions and
discharged soldiers. But the law did not long remain in force.
