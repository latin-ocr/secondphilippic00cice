That the general condition of affairs was not so
hopeful as C'icero had been assured on his journey,
was seen on the 1st of September, in the meeting of
the senate convened by Antonius in the temple of
Concordia. Antonius there proposed, that in all sup-
plicatione-sa day in honour of Oaesar should be added ²¹⁴,
i. e. that on occasion of every thanksgiving for public
successes, a special day should be appropriated for
offerings to the deified Oaesar ²¹⁵. As Cicero was
doubtless informed beforehand of the subject of the
deliberation, he excused himself to Antonius for non-
appearance, on the plea that he had not recovered
from the fatigue of his journey. The threat which
Antonius thereupon let fall, that he would pull down

his house about his ears ²¹⁶, was not indeed carried out,

but it plainly shewed that he was determined that the

which, as these regular trials were introduced for most offences,
gradually delegated its powers to the praetor and the iudices
appointed by him. ²¹⁴) Phil. 11. ἓ 110: aen afflicationaes
addendo diem contaminasti passus es etc. 216) This
explanation is favoured by Dio XLIII. 44: ‘They granted Caesar
a public residence, and a special festival (ἱερομηνίαν ἐξαίρετον :pro-
pm'am supplicationem), whenever sacrifices should be offered in
honour of a victory ς’ where however Dio is mistaken iu fixing
the date of this grant immediately after the battle of Munda.
He says correctly of the honours conferred after Caesar’s death,
(XLV. 7): ‘on certain thanksgivings for victory (ἱερομηνίαις) they .
offered sacrifices in honour of his name on a day specially appro-
priated to that purpose! And of the triumvirs he says (XLVII.
18): ‘They founded a ehapel (ἡρῷον) to him as a hero in the
Forum and on the spot where he had been burnt, and also at the
horse-races (ludis circensibus) carried an image of him in pro-
cession with one of Venus ; and when news came of any victory,
they granted the distinction of a thanksgiving severally to the
conqueror and to Caesar even after his death.' I have cited
these passages at length, because the account in Drumann
(Ι. 192) and Briickner (1. 731) is inaccurate. 21⁶) Phil. 1.
