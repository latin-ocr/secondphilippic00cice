consular should decl-are himself either as friend or foe.
On the following day the senate again assembled in ξ 5 5
the temple of Ooncordia3 Cicero appeared, but no
Antonius. In this sitting Cicero delivered the first
of his speeches against Antonius, known as 'Philip-
picsffl. In it he endeavoured to explain his long
absence from the senate and sudden return, deprecated
Antonius’ harsh requital of his non-attendance the
day before, and frankly spoke his mind about the line·
of policy pursued by the consul and his colleague‚ yet
still with a certain reserve and moderation *, as he was
loath entirely to foreclose every avenue of accommo-
dation. Antonius, who was irritated by the speech ξ 56
beyond measure, immediately renounced his friendship,
and did not long delay an answer ²¹⁸. In a meeting of

²¹⁷) If we may trust the collection of letters between Cicem
and Brutus, the occasion of this title was accidental. Brutus
writes 11. 5. §4: Leyi orationes duas mas, quonum altera Kal.
Ian. mus es (Phil. v.), altera cle litteris meis (Phil. x.), quae habita
est abs te conbra Calenum. Nunc scilicet hoc exspectas, elam eas
laudem. Nescio animi em ingenii mi maior in his libellis laus
amimam. Iam concedo ut vel Philippici vocentur, quod tu
quadam epistola iocans scripsisti. And Cicero says Π. 4. ἕως
De te etiam dixi tam quae dicenda putavi. Haec ad te oratio
perferrem, quoniwm. te video delectari Philippicis nostris. In
the historians and grammaxians, as well as in the MSS„ the
speeches are called Philippicae ,· A. Gellius however always uses
the title ‘ Orationes Antonianae! [Plut. (cic. 24 and 48) distinctly
says that Cic. himself entitled his speeches against Antonius
Philippics. So App. b. c. 1v. 20. Plutarch also (Cic. 41) cites a
written reply of Antonius to the Philippics (ἐν ταῖς πρὸς τοὺς
Φιλιππικοὺς ἀντιγραφαῖς). Quintil. m. 8. ἓ 46: cam Ciceroni
dabimus consilium, ‘ ut Antonium roget‚' vel etiam ‘ut Philippicas’
(ita vitam pollicente eo) ‘exurat’ (These seem to have been
favourite themes for rhetorical exercises. See Seu. suas. VI.).

’ Suet. rhet. 5 and Juvenal also use this title. Gellius four times

(Ι. 22, vn. 11, xm. 1, and αι οι· 22) cites Antonianae, once
