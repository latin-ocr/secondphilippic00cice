parts, a defensive, in which the orator rebuts the
charges brought against himself, and an offensive, in
which he paints in the darkest colours the public and
private life of his opponent. In order to give the
composition the freshness of a spoken harangue, it

back, that it was a happy chance for him that Cicero had not
spoken as he had written ; otherwise he should have missed the
delicious mullets of Massilia (ib. XL. 54).] 221) Of. ep. ad
