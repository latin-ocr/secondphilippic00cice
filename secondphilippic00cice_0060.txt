(ib.x1.v.18-47) is in great part a reproduction of it.]
[† In the proscription of the triumvirs Lepidus gave up to death
his brotherL. Paullus, Antonius his uncle L. Caesar (infr. ἓ 14), and
Octavianus cicero(1.'iv.pen00h. cxx. Plut. Cic. 46). Antonius
despatched the centurion Herennius and M. Pop ilius Laenas, by

whom Cicero was murdered 7 Dec. Β. ο. 43, aet. 64. (dial. de
orat. 17. ἓ 2. See the extracts from Livy and others, all
describing the murder, in Sen. suas. 63 cf. Plut. Ant. 20, cie.
48, 49). App. b. c.1v. 20: ‘Then Laenas,t11'0ughhehad once won an
action through Cicero’s advocacy, drew his hegad from the litter and
cut it offi striking or rather sawing it three times3 so unhandy
was he. He likewise cut off the hand, wherewith Cicero wrote
those orations against the tyranny of Antonius, which in imita-
tion of Demosthenes he called Philippica. On the instant ex-
presses posted away by sea andland to convey the good news to
Antonius. Laenas on his arrival, finding Antonius seated in
the forum, waved the head and hand while yet a long way
off, by way of displaying them. Antonius overjoyed put a
crown on the centurion’s head, and gave him over and above the
promised reward 250‚000 Attio drachms, as having rid him of
the greatest and most rancorous of his enemies. Cicero's head
and hand long hung from the rostra, where he used to speak;
and more now flocked together to see him, than formerly to hear.
It is said that Antonius set Oicero’s head before the table at his
meai, till he had glutted himself with the sight? Fulvia is said
(Dio XLVII. 8) to have placed the head upon her knees, and
pricked with hair-pins the tongue which hapd abused her. On
receiving the ghastly offering, Antonius exclaimed that the pro-
scription was complete (Plut. Cic. 49 9.) Of. Vell. 11. 64. ἐξ 3, 4:

Haec eunt tempora, quibus M. Tullius continuis actionibus aeternas
Antonii memoriae inussit notas. Sed liic fulqentissimo et caelesti
ore, at tribunus Canutius continua rabie lacerabat Antonium. ’
