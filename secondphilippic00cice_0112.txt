where have Ι shewn ingratitudo! ‘ In the 1st Philippic (Sept. 2.)'
No, truly ς Ι then blamed your measures, but did not touch your
petsson. To-day you shall leam how much you owed to my
or earance.

lv. ἓ 7. He also read a letter, as from me. §8. Let the
ill-breeding pass ;—mark his fully—Tiro and Mustela may ap-
plaud your eloquence (as I shall, if you procure their acquittal
for this day's work οἱ intimidating the senate) ; but how wiu au
your eloquence coniute me, if Ι disown the letter? Not by the
handwriting3 for it is a clerk's. Ο for a chance like your mas-
ter's (the rhetorician Sext. Clodius, 5 101), who earns estates by
making a blockhead of his scholar! 5 9. However the letter was
mine ; nor will I deny that it addressed you as a man of honour.
Ι shall not retaliate by publishing that, in which you beg me to
allow the recall of the other Sext. Clodium ξ ιο. a superfluous
reggest, if he were already, as you say, included in a general
p on.

Second charge. My cwulship. (Β. 0. 63. c. v—vm.) § to.

chief consulars of that day, ξ 14, and among the rest by L. Caesar;
whose counsels you, his sister's son, then rejected for those of
your step-father the traitor Lentulus ; ξ 15, as now for those of
parasites or pimps, whose birthdays you spend in feasting, care-
1888 of the delay of public business. c. vn. ‘Your consulship
heals the wounds which mine opened.’ And this you say in that
temple of Concord in which Ι consulted the senate's every wish,
and which you are besetting with assassins! ἓξ] 16, 17. ⁴ I posted
armed slaves on the ascent of the CapitoL' (5 Dec. A. Π. 691:
7 Feb. Β. ο. 62). Not slaves 3 every knight, every high-born
youth but you, enlisted in defence of order. ⁴ I denied the body
of Lentulus for buriaL’ A falsehood too gross even for P. Clo-
dius3 ἓ 18, but why remind us in what school you were bred a
traitorz VIII. You confess the crime, for which Ι arrested
Lentulus, but complain of his execution, i. e. you blame the
senate's work, and praise mine. §19. ‘I posted an armed
force on the ascent to the Capitol.' Yes, a force of citizens to

your barbarian bowmen, ἓ 20. You are pleased to crack a jest
