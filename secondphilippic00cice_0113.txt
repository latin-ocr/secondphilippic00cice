Δ they have been serviceable to our youth, and no discredit to the
Roman name.

Third charge. The murder of P. Clodius. (c. IX.) §an ‘I
tutored Milo to kin P. Clodius.’ (18 Jan. A. u. 702 =8 Dec. Β. o.
53). What if you, Ant„ had despatched Clodius, when you
chased him through the forum with drawn sword? (Β. 0. 53).
Ι cheered you on, I confess3 you will scarcely say that I tutored
you. ἓ 22. If this charge were true, we shoiild 118ν8 heard it on

Milo's trial. (March Β. c 52).

Fourth charge. The civil war. (c. rx, x.) ξ ἰ 3. ‘I caused
Pompeius’ alienation from Caesar, i.e. the civil war.’ An error
in dates still more than of fact. ‘Distinque tempora! x. In
C.esar's consulship Rc: 59, I did warn Pompeius against him.
But when Pompeius had married his daughter, further remon-
strance was hopeless. §24 Yet twice I did remonstrate3 (ι)
against the prolongation of Caesar's command, B.c. 55, (2) against
his admission as a candidate for the consulship in his absence
Β. 0. 52. But when a rupture was imminent, I never ceased to
promote peace.

Fifth charge. Oaesar’s murder. (15 Mar. 44. c. xx--xw.)

my hands, forcing upon me undeserved honours. For how could

torn? §27- Domitius had private wrongs to revenge3 others
were so bound to Oaesar that 1 could not have dared to sound
them, if the plot had been mine. xn. ξ 28. ‘Brutus raised his
dagger, reeking with Oaesar's blood, and wished me joy, singling
me out by name.’ Yes; because Ι too as consul had saved the
country. ἓ 29. If it is a crime in me to rejoice at our deliver-
ance, it is a crime of which 110 honest man is clear. ἓ 30. Me
you condemn on a mere suspicion of complicity; Brutus, whose
hand dealt the blow, ‘you wish to name with all respect.¹
Soatter the fumes of last night’ 8 debauch3 and, by your consul-
ship I conjure you, tell us plainly; are Brutus and the rest

33. Consequently, —the reasoning is eugen& however the dilemma
may bewildcr you—you must hold them for liberators. Good;
I deny the charge no longer3 I will beg the conspirators to
confirm it, · I glory in being shut up, as in the Trojan horse,
amid a company, where the least is a hero, whom to have seen
is an epoch in any man's life. ΧΠ. ,S 34. Yet if my stilus
