54 ARGUMENT. 00.x1v-x1x. §§ 34—·47.

Ι retort your accusation? You discussed such a plot with 'Pre-
bonius at Narbo (Β. ο. 45). ξ 35. You are the greatest gainer
by Caesar’s death, for you inherit his power, ξ 36, and have
cleared off your debts. N ay, do not be startled; no one will
believe it of you 3 no one will give you credit for patriotism.

Lighter charges. (c. xv, XVI.) My yloom and illtimed jests
in Pompeius’ cwmp. (Β. ο. 48). 537. I then tried to avert
min by peaceful counsels. ἓ 38. Pompeius would not bate one
jot of dignity, Ι sought safety first, next dignity. But these
differences never interrupted our friendship. ἓ 39. On his
flight from the field of Pharsalus Pompeius confessed that, if
he had been the more sanguine, I had proved the truer prophet.
And are you jealous for the memory of Pompeius against me his
friend,—you who are living on his spoils? XVI. Ι may now
and then have enlivened life in camp by a jest. §40. Your
censure of my melancholy and my mirth may prove that neither
transgressed the mean. ‘N ο friend ever remembered me in hi·
wilL’ My books tell another tale. Not that I can boast your
luck, for whom a perfect stranger, Rubrius, ἓ 41, disinherited
not only his brother’s sou, but also his declared heir, young
Fufius. By as odd a whim L. Turselius discarded his brother

His early profliyacy. (c. xvm, xix. ἓξ 44-4 7.) ξ 44. While
yet a boy you became bankrupt, but still appeared among the
knights, not on the scats assigned to bankrupts by the Rosa-ian
law. You disgraced the gowu of manhood by prostituting your
body to all comers ς till young Curio outbid his rivals by the offer
of a permanent settlement. gg 45, 46. I persuaded the elder
Curio to discharge a bond which the son had signed on your
behalf, on condition that you never entered the house again.
