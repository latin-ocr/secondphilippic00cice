tei-day a beggar, to-day a Croesus‚' ξ 66, in a few weeks you wastod
au that ill-gotten wealth. §67. There might be seen one in-
cessant debauch, without stint or check. ἓ 68. How can you
eroes that threshold, xxvm, or see those trophies at the gate, and
not be maddened with remorae? ξ 69. For me, I pity the very
walls and roofs. But you have turned a new leaf. You have
solemnly put away the aotress3 so far well; but what must we
think of him, whose life can boast no more virtuous act than such
a divor-ee? ξ 70. What then ean you mean by that favourite
phrase, ‘ both a consul and Antonius,’ if not ⁴ both a consul and a
debauchee '¹3 But I return to your peculiar work, the civil war*-

Oz'vil war in Africa and Spain. (nc. 47—45· o. xxix, xxx.)
ἒ 71. You hung back, while Oaesar fought in Africa, and were
required on his return to pay for the house of Pompeius. ξ 72.
In spite of your outcry, ξ 73, Caesar was enforcing payment, when
you advertised for sale the plate, furniture, and slaves ; all ngev-
ously damaged while in your hands. ἓ 74. On Rubrius‘ heirs
(ἓ 4ο) forbidding the sale, you tried to rid yourself of Oaesar by
an assassin’s knife. On Caesar's departure for Spain, you again
lingered behind3 so sturdy a gladiator might surely have been
less impatient for discharge. xxx. ξ 75. You set out at last,
but turned back, ‘finding the roads dangeroue! Dolabella, how-
ever, could make his way to the field of Munda (17 Mar. B.c. 45),
though he had not the private quarrel which you have with the
heirs of- Pompeius.

Antonius' return from Narbo. (Rc. 45. o. xxx, XXXI.) ἓ 76.
You asked how I returned the other day (31 Aug. 44). Not in
the dark, as you did last year from Narbo ; not in easy undress,
but in the full Roman costume. XXXI. ξ 77. Mei-ely for the

pleasure of giving Fulvia a surprise, you startled the whole of ,

Italy. § 78. This was one of the ‘private affairs ’ which brought
you to Rome ς another was to save your securities from distraint.

ANTONIUS CONSUL. (13.0. 44. o. xxxa—end.)

Thwwts Dolabella's election. (e. xxxn, xxxm.) On Caesar's
return (Sept. or Oct. 45) you became reconciled to him. ἓ 79.
He made· you consul for the next year with himself, breaking his
word to Dolabella, who thereupon bitterly denounced you (1 J an.
44). ἓ 80. On Caesar's promising to retire, you threaten as
augur to vitiate Dolabella's election, ξ 81, neither knowing that
as augur you have less power of obstruction than as consul, nor
scrupling to predict an informality long before the day of elec-
tion. §82 Not ’to dwell on your slavish deference to Caesar,
xxxm, I come to the day of Dolabella's electiori. After the
votes had been declared, §83, you pronounced the proceediugs
