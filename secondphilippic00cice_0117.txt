null and void, as you had threatened. ἓ 84. And yet now you
allow their validity.

Antonim offers Ooesafr a diadem on the Lupercalia. (15 Feb.
44. c. XXXIV.) You change colour at the sound ‘Lupercalia
Indeed if your eloquence can remove that slur, your liberality to
Sext. Clodius is justified. g 85. When Caesar pushed back the
profer-red diadem, ἓ 86, you fell at his feet, entreating him to en-
slave us. A consul, you harangued the Roman people in the
apron of a Lupercus. Your conscience, if not utterly seared,
must bleed as I recall that scene3 my words must prick you to
the quick. §87. You register in the calendar your offer and
Caesar’s refusal. No wonder you hate law and order, which can-
not consist with tyranny.

Antonius in Rome on and after the Ides of March. (15 Mar.
⁴4· c. xxxv—XXXIX.) §88 On the Ides of March Czesar was
to have opened the debate on the election. His death removed
all your scruples about its legality.—-His death 3-after which
you were spared, ’ς 89, in spite of my warnjngS. On the third
day (17 Mar.) I attended the meeting of the senate in the tem-
ple of Tellus, XXXVI. §90‚ and· lament your apostasy from the
principles you then professed. Yet even then your fair words
were belied by your funeral oration on the tyrant, §9ss and
by your instigation of rioters ; although to please the senate you
abolished the dictatorship, and prohibited arbitrary immunities
and acts of grace. ξ 9²· Then suddenly your proclamatione
appear, bestowing immunities and the franchise on whole states.
XXXVII. ἓ 93. You embezzle the treasures in the temple of
Ops, and in Caesar’s name sel] privileges to all comers; even
king Deiotarus, ἓ 94, who in Caesar's lifetime could never obtain
common justice, is restored by the dead caesar, ἓ 95, 96, for
the king’s envoys had bribed Fulvia; while their bolder master
no sooner heard of the tyrant's death, than he recovered his
throne by force of anns. xxxvm. ξ 97. Your forged ‘notes
of Oaesar‘ were hawked about the streets like playbills. In
Caesar’s name you decreed that from and after Brutus' departure
&eto should cease to be a province 3 forgetting that while Caesar
lived Brutus had no connexion with Crete. ἓ 98. You recalled
the exiled convicts, and yet excepted three or four from pardon,

him. You struck his name out of the commission for dividing
lands. You divorced his daughter, after blasting her character
by a charge of adultery with Dolabella (1 Jan. 44. cf. ἓ 79).
XXXIX. ἓ 100. You neglected to convene the committee ap-
pointed to ascertain Caesar’s genuine acts (ι June 44).
