colony in Capua, you nearly lost your life. ἓ 101. You assigned
to your dissolute retainers Oampanian and Leontine lands, so
crippling the public revenues. XI.. ξ 102. With much state
you planted a colony at Casilinum, though warned that it would
confuse auspices to settle two colonies in one place. ς 103.
You then took up your quarters in Varro’s house at Casinum,
which not even by right of confiscation could you claim as your
own, ἓ 104, as Caesar had commanded you to restore it. xm.
ἓ 105. That abode of learning you stained with riotous orgies,
dismissing unseen the neighbours who came to greet their
consul. ἓ 106. With as lordly a disdain you repelled the
homage of Aquinum and Anagnia. ξ 107. You roundly rated
the Sidicini and men of Puteoli for choosing the liberators as
their patrous. XLII. In your absence, Dolabella had rased the
altar and pillar erected in honour of Caesar. But you found
means to curb the dangerous activity of your colleague.

Retur‘n of Ant. io Rome. (c. xm.) ξ 108. You enter Rome
at the head of your troops in order of battle. On 1 June 44
the senators durst not come together. ξ 109. Their absence
did not prevent you from repealing the law limiting the tenure
of proconsulships. You also rifled the ‘people's park’ beyond

have been voted to Caesar, and you are his flamen„ Why are
you not consecrated? Yesterday (18 Sept.) was the 4th day
of the ludi Romani in circo, to-day by your law (of 1 Sept.)
is a 5th day of festival, in honour of Caesar. Why is the feast
not observed? ἓ 111. I wait for your eloquent rejoinder. For
even your grandfather, consummate orator as he was, was not
so transparently clear as you; he never spoke so lightly clad
as you at the Lupercalia.

PERORATION. (e. xn1v÷end.)

Force put upon the senate by Antonius ; clareats of retaliatitm.
(c. XLIV.) ἓ 112. Why is the senate hemmed in with troops
as Ι speak? To guard the consul? Better a thousand deaths
than life so secured. ἓ 113. The people will wrest those arms·
from your hands, Fulvia, your wife, has paid two instalments
of her debt—(her former husbands, Clodius and Ourio)-the
third has long been due. The state can find worthier rulers
when you are no more. ἓ 114. Our deliverers may be absent,
but their glory remains.

Gall to repentance and amendment. (c. ΠΝ, XLVI.) ς 115.
