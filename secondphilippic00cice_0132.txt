KRUEGER. The concurrence of two relatives, or of a relative
and conjunction, in one clause is foreign to our idiom. Trans-
late, ‘indeed even now it is only their want of such a leader,
that has saved ‘you from the fate of those conspirators.']

[1. 9. accidit eontiyisset. Accido denotes any casual and
unforeseen occurrence; like our word ‘accident’ it is commonly
used of missortunes3 e. g. si quid acciderit, ‘if anythmg shall
happen to him.’ Contineo, properly ‘to meet,’ denotes some
connexion between the occurrence and the person, so that the
one fits (προςήκει) the other ; so here ‘you would have met your
deserts;’ hence it is commonly used in-a. good sense. cf. Juv-
vm. 28, and esp. Sen. epist. 110. §3: scis plura mala contin-
9ere nobis quam accidere (‘misfortunes are oftener a. blessing
than a curse’). quoties enim felicitatis causa et initium fuit quod
calamitas vocabatwr. Evenire denotes ‘the coming into being,
the issue, upshot,’ etc„ i. e. it presupposes expectation and pre-
paration. See Seyffert ad Lael. pp. 39, 40. Omztinyit is used
in malam partem, as here, also de orat. Π. ἓ 15: magis id
facilitate quam ulla alia eulpa mea contiyit] vitrici. [ξ 14„
p. 7. 1. 1.] Plut. (Ant. 2) adds: ‘ Ant. said that the body of
Lentulus was not given up for burial until his mother (Julia wife
of Lent.) begged it of Cicero's wife (Terentia). An evident
falsehood3 for none of those executed by Cic. was debari-ed
from intermeat? [Of. Juv. x. 286 seq]
