absentis ratione habenda decem tribuni pl. ferrent? His ille rebus
ita convaluit, ut nunc in uno cive (Pomp.) spes ad resistendum sit,

l. 27. ferri etc. The lex ut ratio absentis Caesaris in peti-
tione emulatus haberetur was carried by M. Oaelius as trib. pl.
52, with the consent of Pompeius. If Cic. dissuaded Pompeius,
he must have played the hypocrite3 for he says himself ep. ad
Att. vn. x. ἓ 4: Nam ut illi hoc liceret (sc. ut Caesar absens eon-
sulatum peteret) adimi, roqatus abipso Ravennae de Caelio m'bwno
pl. Ab ipso autem 2 etiam a Gnaeo nostro in illo divino tertio con-
sulam. [In early times consuls etc. were often elected in their
absence; e.g. in the 7th cent. [Lo. Marius and Lucullus. Cic.
too in his consulship (de leg. agr. 11. ἓ ²4) says that no candidates
for office need appear in person. Yet 3 years later (3.0. 60)
Caesar was on the point of foregoing a triumph in order to satisfy
the law by which absentees were disqualified. In Β.ο. 52, at the
time of which cio. here speaks, the lex Pompeia de iwre mayis-
tratunm contained a clause (Suet. Caes. 28) ‘ quo a petitione hono-
rum absentes submovebat? Pomp. added an exception in Caesar’s
favour after the law had been deposited 'in the aerarium. Becker,
