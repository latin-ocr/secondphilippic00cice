80 L. BRUTUS. IMAGINES. FORIS. [11 25 26

1. 17. Citius, sooner,’ passing into the sense of patim, for
which reason quam ut follows, as after potius. [Just as our
‘’rather originally meant‘ earlier,’ andas‘ sooner 'often= rather3
and 111 vulgar English‘ I would die first) Of. the Germ. ‘.eher ’]

1. 17. aliquos. e.g. P. com. Lentulus Spinther, ad Fam. ΧΠ..
14. §6. [and O. Octavius, Plut. Caes. 67. ABR. App. b. civ, 11.
119, Dio xmv. 21.]

[1. 18. [comcii] Madvig]

ἓ 26. 1. ’11. nem. i.e. nullius nomen ; not having learnt the
art of politio reserve.

[l. 22. auctores ad truso. 1 ξ 26. p. Sest ἓ 42. Kocn. ]

L 23. auctoribus. ‘authors, devisers‚' 80. caedis. Madvig
[Opusc. 1. 164] reads actoribus. Brutos. Marcus and Β801111118.

1. 24„ L. Brutus, the founder of the rep ublie. His pau-iciam
family became extinct on the death of his two sons (Dionys.
V. 18. Dio XLIV. 12); the later Junii were of plebeian deseent.
But it was for the interest of Gaesar’s murder-ers to represent the
Bruti as descendants of the first champion of liberty. Plut.
(Brut. 1), who appeals to Posidonius, has allowed himself to be
misled. [Phil. 1. ἓ 13: ille Brutus, qui et ipse dominatu reyio rem
gntblicoem liberavit et adtsimilem virtutem et sim-‘ilc factwn ste-pem
3ἒαῖῗῖ ²3lgugqgessfessgnufflfflngff''gffgffflghfflff{im 33¹3ss
Marcus, unknown hands wrote at night, ‘Would that thou wert
living !’ ‘Thy posterity is degenerate’ ‘Brutus, art thou dead ’ζ’
and again, ‘Thou art not sprung from him ξ’ ⁴ Brutus, dost thou
take bribes 2‘ (App. 11. 112, cf. Plut. Brut. 9.).]

1. 25. Ahalae. Servilia, Marcus’ mother, traced her pedigree
to O. Servilius Ahala, who slew Sp. Maelius B.c. 439. [Plut.
Brut. 1. Of. infr. ἓ 27. 1. 13. ἐξ 87, 114. From Polyb. VI.
53. ξ 5 seq. we leam that imayines were painted masks of wax,
worn at funera-Is by men 01108811 for their resemblance to those
anuestors of the deceased whom they personated. Sometimes
easts were taken from the face of a corpse (Quintil. vl. 1. §4o).
They eoriespond to our ‘family portraits.’ Here we see that
imayines of maternal ancestors were included; in Vatin. ἓ 28
Vatinius, brother· m· law of M. Antonius, has those of the An-
1101111. In Tac. Ann. 111. 76, those of twenty famffies are carried
in one funeral. ]
