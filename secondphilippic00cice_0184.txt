ser-vasso) de caelo, was enough to make σωηὶιία impossible for the
day (comitia i ' e). This important right probably tested on
the belief in presentiments granted,to magistrates solemnly
consecrated, whereby they could presage, that on certain days
the divine win would be manifested by signs in heaven ; hence
the mere declaration of the intention to seek such signs was
sufficient to postpone the comitia.

L 19. Nos, the college of augurs.

l. αι. etiam is added, because one magistrate could also
obnuntvkm to another, i. e. suspend his proceedings by asserting
that he had noticed an inauspicious sign.

election were held on some day between 1 Jan. and 15 Feb. 44.]

l. ¹16. quid vitii etc. i. e. one cannot, without making
mockery of religious institutions, anticipato the appearance of
unfavourable signs, (cannot, that is, determine beforehand on an

per leges. Cic. probably means the lex Clodia of Β.ο. 58 which
abrogated the leae Aelia and Fufia. Cic. p. Sest. ἓ 33 : lata lex
(i. e. Clodia) est, m auspiom valerent, ne quis οόητιηιίακνει, ἠε quis
leyi intercederet ,· ut omnibus festis ‹ia'aebas leqem fem-i licere& ut
lex Aelia, lex Fufia nc valeret. (The lex Aelia regulated the right of
spectio and obnuntiatio ; the ιω) Fufia appointed that legislative
comitia should not be held on every dies fastus without exception.)
For though after Β. o. 58 several obmmtiatwmoe occur (p. Sest.
ἐξ 78, 79, 83, 129· of. Phil. 1. ἓ 25, Π. ἓ 83), it does not follow
that the lex Clodia was formally repealed, but only that the old
practice was resumed‚ in spite of its prohibition. Thus Oic. says;
it is illegal cle caelo servare at the comitia, but if it is done, it should
be done before they begin, and not when business is actually in

progress.
