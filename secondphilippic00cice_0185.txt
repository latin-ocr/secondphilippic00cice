c. xxxm. 1. 4 seq. Ecce etc. The voting in the comm cm-
turiata at this time took place according to the. reformed constitu-
tion ot* the centuries. The chief change introduced by the reform
was the combination of the local division of the people in 35
districts (to-ibus) with the Servian division. Neither the time of
this reform (Mommsen rom. Gesch. 1. 796. ed. τ. dates it B.o.
²4¹) nor the number of the new centuries is exactly known ; it is
most likely, however, that the 35 tribes were divided into 350
centuries. By the Servian constitution the people was divided
into 5 classes according to property, and each class was sub-
divided into itmwres and seniores. This division was applied to
the tribes in such a way, that each tribe was divided according to
property into 5 classes, each class according to age into two
halvcs. Thus each of the 35 tribes contained 10 centur-ies, and
70 oentuxies (35 iuniorum and 35 seniorum) formed one class.
Whether beside the 70 centuries from the tribes each class
contained a distinct century of artisans (faho-12, liticines, comicines),
as Mommsen assumes (die ro'm. Tribus in administrade Be-
zv'aekunq, esp. p. 92), cannot be proved, but is probable, because
that would give an odd no. (71) of centuries in each class for
voting. To the 350 centur-ies forming the tribes were further
added the 18 (or probably at this time only η, cf. Liv. xnm. 16)
centurias of knights, which were retained as distinct centuries
from the Servian constitution. (Thus Cic. plainly distinguishes
the tribes from the centul-ies of knights, or. Phil. vn. ἓ 16: Est

first, and the oentuoeia praeroyativa (century that voted first) was
determined by lot. That this was taken from the 70 centur-ies of
the first class, is probable‚ but it remains uncertain, whether from
all 70, or only from the 31 vribus macae imum-um. When the
centnm-iae equitum gave their votes, whether immediately after the
pracroyativa, or together with the centuries of the first class, or
after them, cannot be determined from other authorities; nor
does our passage lead to any certain result, as it is doubtful
whether the centuries of knights are mentioned here or no.
As far as the words deinde, ita ut adsolet, suffrayia, all is plain.
‘The day for D's election comes ι the praeroyativa is determined
by lot3 Ant. holds his peace. Its vote is proclaimed; still he is
silent. The first class is called soz-ward, and its vote announoed
otc? But the word suffr-aych is very variously interpreted. Some,
