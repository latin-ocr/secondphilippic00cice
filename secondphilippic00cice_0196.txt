ported the Romans in numerous wars. The services which he
*rendered to Sulla, Murena, Servilius Isauricus, and esp. to
Lucullus, procured repeated decrees of the senate in his honour
(Phil. xl. ξ 33 seq.). Pompeius also availed himself of his aid
in the Mithridatio war. At a later date he was rewarded by
the senate with the title of king, and with the sovereignty of
lesser Armenia. In Β. ο. 51 he won the friendship of Cicero,
then proconsul of Cilicia, by placing his entire forces at his
disposal. He fought at the battle of Pharsalus, and accompanied
Pompeius in the earlier part of his ssight. In‘November B.o. 45
Cicero defended his friend from a charge of plotting Oaesar’s
murder. The speech, delivered in Caesar’s house, is extant.

call this position of iqitur a solecism by ‘transmutatio’ (such
as it would be to begin a sentence with quoque, em'mi, or mutem„
because the best authorities differed, some never beginning a
sentence with mitam, others frequently doing so. Many in-
