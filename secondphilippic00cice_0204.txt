P. 42. 1. 1. coloniae, which Capua became Β. ο. 59 by a law
of the consul Caesar. See p. Sest. ἓ 9, whence we leam that
Cicero was patronus of Capua.

§103. 1. 3. Μ. Terentius Varro, the greatest ‘Polyhistor’
and the most prolific writer of Roman antiquity, was a §tm-dy
Pompeiam, and (Β. o. 49) aa legatus of Pompeius in Spain fought
at the head of two legions against Oaesar. In spite of politi-cal
antipathies Caesar valued him for his learning. Suet. 44: de
ornanda instruendaque Urbe, item de tuendo ampliandoque im·
perio plwra ac maiora in dies destinabat...bibliothecas Graecas et
Latinas, quas maximas posset, publicare, data M. Varroni cura
comparandarum ac diyerendcvrum etc. [In the history of Rome
written by a ‘Polyhistor’ of our day, Th. Mommsen, there is an
eloquent account of Varro and his works; Mommsen seems
however to have exaggerated the literary power of his hero as un-
duly as he has depreciated that of Cicera]

aviary, and mentions a museum, fishponds, terranea, etc. On

1. 5. L. Rubrii, Cic. had at first written Scipionis (father-in-
law of Pompeius, cf. ξ 109. 1. 23), ¹which he altered at the sug-
gestion of Atticus (ς 86. l. 25 n.)

in praedia. Supply from advolas the more general notion

l. 7. ab hasta, ‘ If it is from an auction that you have them,
let the auction stand, and let the accounts stand, provided only
they be Caesar's, not yours ; those by which you are proved
a debtor, not those by which you rid yourself from debt.’ si ab
