(ad Qu. fr. 11. 7, ad Att. ΧΠ. 1. ς ι).]

L gl. η. esset. ‘as though he really were consul? cf. §68.
¹l.¹l3]. sed sum vicinus. This emendation of the MS. reading
sed cum uinus is due to Madvig. [See his opusc. 11. 330: ‘ Puto
Ciceronem significasse, so cum villam in illa. vicinia haberet, ex
ipsis Anagninis recentem rem audivisse, cum siue ulla. varietate
narraretur.']

l. 15. Mustelam et Laconem. ἓ 8. l. 17 n. In the rough copy
of the speech which cic. sent to Atticus (ad Att. xvr. 11. ζξ 3 in
Intr. ἓ 56. n. “), the names were wanting, and Atticus asked
who the duo sinay-nini might be. In the published speech the
names were added for the sake of clearness. (Manut. less pro-
bably condemns them as a gloss.)

Campania, whose capital was Teanum.

[Puteolanos. At Puteoli (‘Wells,' now I’ozzzwli), a gmat
commercial city on the northern‘shore of the hay of Cumae, Cic.
had a fine villa (Academia, Plin. hist. nat. xxm. ἓ 6; see the
epigram by a freedman of Cieerds, ibid. ξ 8), to which Hirtius
and Pansa came in this year 44 to practise declamation with the
orator, ‘leaving him no rest even at the baths ' (ad Att. ΧΠ. 12.
ξπ). During the progress of Ant. (April and May) Cic. was
there more than once (ib. 7. ἓ 1, 16. ξ 1, 20. ξ 1), and was visited
by Octavius (Augustus. ib. 11. ἓ 2, 12.§ 2). There too ho re-
vised this speech (Intr. ἓ 56. n. ⁴⁹). On the name cf. Varr. L. L.
v. ἓ 25: A puteis oppidum Puteoli, quod incircum eum locum
aquae sviqidae et caldae multae]

[l. 19. patronos adamassem. So Orelli inser. 7115: hunc ob
merita elus crya ‘rem publicam ordo decurionum patronum mu-
nicipi (spoletii) adoptavit. Cic. p. Sest. ξ 9 (supr. ἓ 100. 1. 4 ιι).
Conquerors became patrous of the new provinces (e. g. the
Marcelli of Sicily, divin. p. anc. §g 2, 13, 16, Verr. 111. ξ 45);
founders, of colonies (p. Sun. ἓ 60) ; orators, of cities or countries
on whose behalf they had pleaded (Tac. dial. 3, 36). The dignity
was hereditary (e. g. Antonius was hereditary patron of Bononia,
Suet. Oct. 17, Dio Ι.. 6). Many inscriptions on marble or brass
<V err. 1v. ἓ 145) remain, attesting this relation ; such tablets
were fastened in the wall of the patron's atrium. Of. the Greek
πρόξενοι, and on the custom generally, Dionys. 11. 11, App. b.
civ. 11. 4. See esp. the humorous account of the statues raised
by the 35 tribes, the knights, the military tribunes, and (last, not
least) the usurers of the middle Ianus, to their patron L. Anto-
nius, Phil. VI. ἐξ 12—15, vn. ἓ 16. See the case οὶ the pseudo-
Maius. Intr. ἓ 38.]
